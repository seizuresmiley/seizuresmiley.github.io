                Python is our language of choice for this project, used for both data collection and analysis.
                <br><br>
                At first, we sourced our list of usernames (AKA handles), from a community maintained list of seiyuus
                then compiled the data into a CSV file.
                <br><br>
                Twitter offers an API that we used to collect user information and tweets. What we learned that we can
                collect 200 tweets per 1 GET request.
                we used a thrid-party library named <a href="">tweepy</a> to simplify the process. Tweepy is a wrapper
                around Twitter's API, which also handles authentication and "paging" for us.
                <br><br>
                We can then write a script to read the csv file, then using the "GET statuses/user-timeine/" API
                endpoint,
                we would have a Tweet object with tweet contents and user information in a JSON format, with each
                request
                yielding 200 tweets. Unfortunately,due to API limitations
                imposed by Twitter, we cannot retrieve more than 3200 tweets without using their paid historical search
                API.
                However, not all users we researched would have 3200 tweets.
                <br><br>
                Then we can dump the data into a JSON file for later analysis. This is to prevent calling the API
                excessively. (this endpoint
                has a limit of 1500 requests per 15 minutes if autheticated using app auth.) It also made sure that
                all users' information
                are pulled in a relatively small timeframe.

                For data analysis, we made some scripts to help us with understanding the data. 
                We leveraged libraries such as "collections" and "pandas" in the process. At first, we used "matplotlib" but the results
                weren't satisfactory. We didn't like how the graphs turned out to be, and the difficulty using the said library.
                <br><br>
                We looked
                for alternatives and found "Pygal" to be the perfect fit for our project. Pygal made interactive charts instead of static images
                like what matplotlib did.
                <br><br>
                For each users, we analysed their favourites accumulation and trends like hashtags and mentioned users.
                <br>
                We also analysed all user's trends like above, and also analysed various metrics such as follower counts, account creation date and following users.

                   From analysing the data, we found out that:
                    <br><br>
                   Most used tweet origin (relates to platform used) is <b>"Twitter for iOS"</b>
                   <br>
                   This took into account that each tweet would have it's own origin tag.

                   User with the most followers: <b><a href="https://twitter.com/aimi_sound" alt="Twitter Link">@aimi_sound</a></b> (Aimi Terakawa)

    <div class="row ">
        <div class="col l4 offset-l4">
            We gained knowledge on using various python libraries and knowledge on using APIs.
            <br><br>
            From analysing the trends, we could see what people we follow are talking about. We would know what to follow.
            Knowing the trends could be advantageous to advertising.
