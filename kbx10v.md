## Memory
The penlight has 2 memory banks for storing user made presets. Each bank can store a total of 30 colors. They will be referred to as Memory 1 and Memory 2. In addition to that, there's 3rd mode which cannot be changed. 

### Saving Presets

First, choose which memory you want to configure, and while the penlight is off: 
- Hold Switch B for 3 seconds while off to configure Memory 1. The penlight will slowly flash red.
- Hold Switch A and B together for 3 seconds to configure Memory 2. The penlight will slowly flash blue.

This will enter the penlight into memory configuration mode.
While in this mode:
 - Press Switch A to cycle between the default colors.
 - Press Switch B to choose the color you would like to save into the memory. 

When done, hold Switch B until it turns off. This will save the configuration.

This will overwrite whatever you saved on the penlight. This includes the presets made on the mobile app.

## Changing Between Memory banks.

While off, hold Switch B for 3 seconds, the penlight will flash red and enter the memory select mode.

Press the Switch C or the "Hot Button" to cycle between the memory banks. Red is Memory 1 and Blue is Memory 2. White is the default mode.

Hold Switch B to turn it off. After this, every time you turn on the penlight it will be in the selected mode.

To reset a memory bank, do as the same above but instead of turning it off like usual, hold Switch A and B together to reset the selected bank. The penlight will turn off afterwards.

## Color Tuning

Hold Switch A to turn on the penlight, when on, hold Switch B to enter connection mode. Proceed forward with the app.

## Hot Button Assignment

Switch C acts like a hotkey for the penlight. You can assign one color to it.

To assign a color to it, hold Switch C for 3 seconds.

To use it, simply press it and it will switch to the color you savd in it.

Pressing Switch A or B will jump back to the previous color you had on. 

The hot button does not care which memory bank you had on, and will jump to the assigned color regardless.
